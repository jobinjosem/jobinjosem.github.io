If you want to customize your PowerShell, then the link is here.In this post, I will explain how I tweaked my bash prompt in WSL using oh-my-posh. Below are the steps I followed to personalize my bash shell.      Install oh-my-posh.    sudo wget https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/posh-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/oh-my-poshsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh            Install a font that supports Powerline symbols.    Download the Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font. Extract the zip file, select them all and right-click to install.        Set the Caskaydia font on the settings of the windows terminal.    Navigate to Windows Terminal –&gt; Settings –&gt; Ubuntu –&gt; Appearance –&gt; Font face. Then choose CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font and click save.        Get the custom configuration file.    mkdir ~/.poshthemesgit clone https://github.com/jobinjosem/oh-my-posh-custom-theme.git ~/.poshthemes            Add the following to ~/.bashrc (could be ~/.profile or ```` depending on your environment)    eval \"$(oh-my-posh --init --shell bash --config '~/.poshthemes/mytheme.omp.json')\"        Once added, reload your profile for the changes to take effect by running exec bash        Add kubectx + kubens  This will help to switch between different kubernetes clusters and namespaces, We need to download the kubectx and kubens binaries and install fuzzyfinderwget -LO kubectx.tar.gz https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx/releases/download/v0.9.4/kubectx_v0.9.4_linux_x86_64.tar.gztar -xvf kubectx.tar.gzchmod +x kubectxmv kubectx /usr/local/bin/wget -LO kubens.tar.gz https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx/releases/download/v0.9.4/kubens_v0.9.4_linux_x86_64.tar.gztar -xvf kubens.tar.gzchmod +x kubensmv kubens /usr/local/bingit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf~/.fzf/install      Relaunch your interactive shell instane    source ~/.bashrc      With kubectx we can easily switch between different Kubernetes clusters by typing x and press enter. A list of available Kubernetes cluster contexts in your kubecfg will be shown.Similarly pressing n will list all the namespaces in the selected cluster and you can select from the list.Thanks for reading. Please do share your feedback.:blush:"
